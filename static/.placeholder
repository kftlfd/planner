Placeholder file to keep this folder in git repo (git ignores empty folders)

In production Django will not serve static files, instead you should configure 
your server to serve static files (they are requested through STATIC_URL) from 
this folder (STATIC_ROOT).
Other option is to use Whitenoise -- https://pypi.org/project/whitenoise/.
To copy all static files from installed apps to STATIC_ROOT (this folder) run:
$ python manage.py collectstatic
